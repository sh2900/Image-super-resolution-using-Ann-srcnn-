This project utilizes the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) to upscale low-resolution images while preserving details and reducing artifacts. SRCNN is a deep learning model that enhances image quality through end-to-end learning, making it ideal for applications like medical imaging, surveillance, and satellite image processing.
For the frontend a user-friendly web interface is built with React.js that allows users to upload images, view results, and compare low-resolution vs. high-resolution outputs.
The backend is implemented using Node.js, handling image uploads, SRCNN model inference, and serving processed images via REST APIs.
The frontend communicates with the Node.js backend through API calls. The backend interacts with the SRCNN model (python) to process images and return high-resolution results.
